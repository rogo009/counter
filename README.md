# counter
counter vanilla js

##another small project to practice vanilla JS. Created a simple counter that can add, subtract and reset. 

##refactored code to avoid repeating the same task / lines of code within each function.

##added the event listener to the reset button, but left the other event listeners as separate handlers.
